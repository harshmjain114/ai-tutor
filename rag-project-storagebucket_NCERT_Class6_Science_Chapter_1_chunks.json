["The Wonderful World of Science1Chapter\nAs human beings, we have always been curious about our \nsurroundings. We start exploring our surroundings and asking questions right from our childhood. Did you enjoy discovering and exploring the world around you in the Preparatory Stage of school? As you enter the Middle Stage, we will continue this fascinating journey, trying to explore and understand the beautiful world we live in. And for that, we have a new subject, Science. Welcome to the wonderful world of Science! \nScience is a way of thinking, observing and \ndoing things to understand the world we live in and to uncover the secrets of the universe. Think of it as a big adventure\u2014we ask questions, explore the world and try to understand how things work. For this, the most important thing is to have \u2018Curiosity\u2019, which is where the title of this book comes from.\nWhether it is studying tiny grains of sand or massive \nmountains, a leaf of grass or a vast forest, there is always something new and exciting to discover. Have you ever looked up at the night sky and wondered why the stars shine? Or watched a flower bloom and wondered how it knows when to open? \nThese are just a few of \nthe many mysteries that science helps us unravel. The most wonderful thing about science is that it is everywhere. From the depths of the ocean to the \nWhat is \nScience??\nA mountainous region\nChapter 1.indd   1 10/4/2024   3:18:10 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 62Science is like a giant and unending jigsaw puzzle. Every \nnew discovery we make adds another piece to that puzzle. \nAnd you know the best thing about this puzzle? There is no limit to what we can discover, since every new piece of knowledge leads to more questions and more things to find out. Sometimes, we find that a piece of this puzzle has been put  in the wrong place and needs to be moved. New discoveries often change our understanding of the world. \nAs you go through this book, you will encounter \ninteresting ideas, do some thought-provoking experiments, and see how some of what we will find out is useful in our vastness of outer space, from what is cooking in the kitchen \nto what is happening on the playground, some of the most groundbreaking discoveries have often come from unexpected places. \nA Desert\n A Coast\nAn underwater view of an Ocean A Galaxy\nChapter 1.indd   2 10/4/2024   3:19:00 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "The Wonderful World of Science3daily lives. And guess what happens as we \ndiscover more and more? We start realising that these ideas are all connected.\nWe will start off by looking at our \nhome, planet Earth. It is the only planet we know that supports life, and it has an environment that we must protect. There is an amazing variety of life on Earth\u2014plants and animals that have managed to survive and thrive in different regions on this planet. You might have seen a seed grow into a plant, a caterpillar transform into a beautiful butterfly and many more such observations. How do these plants and animals grow?\nWhat will we \nexplore with the help of this book? ?\nOf course, to grow, we need food to eat, and especially in \na large and diverse country like India, food is so fascinating. \nAcross the country, we have different cuisines with their many tasty dishes. What are they made of? How do we find out? \nChapter 1.indd   3 10/4/2024   3:19:50 PM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 64\nThen again, there are so many different things around \nus\u2014the paper we write on, the metal key, the plastic ruler \nand the rubber eraser in our box, the magnet that keeps the box closed, the clothes we wear, the cup we drink milk in and so many other things. What are they made of? Are they made of different materials? How do we separate different materials from one another?Along with food, we need water to survive. Water is such a \ndelightful substance. Have you ever jumped in a puddle when it rained? Do you ever wonder why and how it rains?\nHave you noticed that water freezes and becomes ice \nwhen we cool it and boils and becomes steam when we heat it? Do you enjoy drinking cool water in the summer or showering with warm water in the winter? How do we understand hot and cold? Whether it is water, or our own body when we have fever, finding out how hot something is can be important!\nChapter 1.indd   4 10/18/2024   9:49:27 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "The Wonderful World of Science\n5We will have an almost unending list of questions about \neverything on Earth as we further explore this book. But \nwhy limit our questions to the Earth alone? We can ask questions on things beyond\u2014the Sun, the Moon, and the millions of stars that shine in the sky!\nWhether you are learning about the \nstructure of a leaf, discovering how things move, or separating the skin of a peanut seed, we hope each chapter of this book will ignite your spirit of inquiry. And hopefully you will have lots of questions on your mind!\nEven though you may have not realised, \nyou have already been fi  nding answers to many of your questions. Suppose your pen stops writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself the question, \u201cWhy did my pen stop writing?\u201d You might guess that the ink fi  nished. \nYou would then test this guess by opening the \npen and checking the ink refi  ll. If it is empty, you would know that your guess was correct. But suppose you found that the ink was not fi  nished. Now what would you do? You would make another guess\u2014perhaps the ink might have dried up. To test if this guess is correct or not, you will try something else. \nThis is exactly how Science \nworks! The way you tried to fi  nd out why your pen stopped writing is an example of the scienti\ufb01  c method.  \nActivity 1.1: Let us think and write\n \u008bWrite about a similar problem that you tried to solve. \n \u008bWhat steps did you take?\nScience is not just about memorising facts and fi  gures or doing experiments.

Though we all apply the scientific method to \nsome extent, learning science will develop our capabilities for finding solutions to bigger problems and solving more mysteries of the universe. And to be able to learn science well, the first and foremost thing is to be curious and observe your surroundings keenly. And when we are curious, we start posing questions, asking how and why? Just remember, the world is full of things we do not know, things that are waiting to be explored.\nActivity 1.3: Let us think and write\n \u008bIf you have to ask \u201cWhy?\u201d about something, what would \nyou ask about?\n \u008bTry to write down how you would attempt to find an answer to your question.\nScience is rarely done alone. Scientists across the world \nwork together, often in large teams. So, if you cannot find an answer yourself, ask your friends to help you out! It is always more fun to discover things together.\nOf course, remember that you will not find answers to  \nall your questions in Grade 6. Do not worry, you are \nembarking upon a journey of science for the next five years or even beyond!\nChapter 1.indd   7 10/18/2024   9:49:28 AM\nReprint 2025-26\n", "Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6\n8Much like children enjoying \nthe rain, science is all about joyful \nexploration.
