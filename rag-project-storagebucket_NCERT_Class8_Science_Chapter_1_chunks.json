["As we look at our surr oundings, we see a lar ge\nvariety of things with dif ferent shapes, sizes\nand textur es. Everything in this universe is\nmade up of material which scientists have\nnamed \u201cmatter\u201d. The air we br\neathe, the food\nwe eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and\nanimals, even a small dr op of water or a\nparticle of sand \u2014 every thing is matter . We\ncan also see as we look around that all the\nthings mentioned above occupy space and\nhave mass. In other words, they have both\nmass* and volume**.\nSince early times, human beings have\nbeen trying to understand their surr oundings.\nEarly Indian philosophers  classified matter in\nthe form of five basic elements \u2014 the \u201cPanch\nTatva\u201d \u2014 air , earth, fir e, sky and water .\nAccording to them everything, living or non-\nliving, was made up of these five basic\nelements. Ancient Gr eek philosophers had\narrived at a similar classification of matter .\nModer n day scientists have evolved two\ntypes of classification of matter based on their\nphysical properties and chemical natur e.\nIn this chapter we shall lear n about\nmatter based on its physical pr operties.\nChemical aspects of matter will be taken up\nin subsequent chapters.\n1.1  Physical Nature of Matter\n1.1.1 M ATTER  IS MADE  UP OF PARTICLES\nFor a long time, two schools of thought prevailed\nregarding the natur e of matter . One school\nbelieved matter to be continuous like a block\nof wood, wher eas, the other thought that matter\nwas made up of particles like sand. Let us\nperform an activity to decide about the natur e\nof matter  \u2014 is it continuous or particulate?Activity ______________ 1.1\n\u2022Take a 100 mL beaker .\n\u2022Fill half the beaker with water and\nmark the level of water .\n\u2022Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help\nof a glass r od.\n\u2022Observe any change in water level.\n\u2022What do you think has happened to\nthe salt?\n\u2022Wher e does it disappear?\n\u2022Does the level of water change?\nIn or der to answer these questions we\nneed to use the idea that matter is made up\nof particles.

With every dilution, though the colour\nbecomes light, it is still visible.\nThis experiment shows that just a few\ncrystals of potassium per manganate can\ncolour a lar ge volume of water (about\n1000 L).

As the temperatur e rises,\nparticles move faster . So, we can say that with\nincrease in temperatur e the kinetic ener gy of\nthe particles also incr eases.\nIn the above thr ee activities we observe\nthat particles of matter inter mix on their own\nwith each other . They do so by getting into\nthe spaces between the particles. This\nintermixing of particles of two dif ferent types\nof matter on their own is called dif fusion.

W e can see that\nmatter ar ound us exists in thr ee dif ferent\nstates\u2013 solid, liquid and gas. These states of\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter .\nNow, let us study about the pr operties of\nthese thr ee states of matter in detail.\n1.3.1 THE SOLID  STATE\nActivity _____________  1.9\n\u2022Collect the following articles \u2014 a pen,\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\nstick.\n\u2022Sketch the shape of the above articles\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\naround them.\n\u2022Do all these have a definite shape,\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\n\u2022What happens if they are hammered,\npulled or dr opped?\n\u2022Are these capable of dif fusing into each\nother?\n\u2022Try compr essing them by applying\nforce. Ar e you able to compr ess them?\nAll the above ar e examples of solids. W e\ncan observe that all these have a definite\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\nthat is, have negligible compr essibility. Solids\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\nsubjected to outside for ce. Solids may br eak\nunder for ce but it is dif ficult to change their\nshape, so they ar e rigid.\nConsider the following:\n(a)What about a rubber band, can it\nchange its shape on str etching? Is it\na solid?\n(b)What about sugar and salt? When\nkept in dif ferent jars these take the\nshape of the jar . Are they solid?\n(c)What about a sponge? It is a solid\nyet we ar e able to compr\ness it. Why?\nAll the above ar e solids as:\n\u2022A rubber band changes shape under\nforce and regains the same shape whenthe force is removed. If excessive force is\napplied, it breaks.\n\u2022The shape of each individual sugar or\nsalt crystal r emains fixed, whether we\ntake it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\na jar.\n\u2022A sponge has minute holes, in which\nair is trapped, when we pr ess it, the air\nis expelled out and we ar e able to\ncompr ess it.\n1.3.2 THE LIQUID  STATE\nActivity _____________ 1.10\n\u2022Collect the following:\n(a)water , cooking oil, milk, juice, a\ncold drink.\n(b)containers of dif ferent shapes. Put\na 50 mL mark on these containers\nusing a measuring cylinder fr om\nthe laboratory.\n\u2022What will happen if these liquids ar e\nspilt on the floor?\n\u2022Measur e 50 mL of any one liquid and\ntransfer it into dif ferent containers one\nby one. Does the volume r emain the\nsame?\n\u2022Does the shape of the liquid r emain the\nsame ?\n\u2022When you pour the liquid fr om one\ncontainer into another , does it flow\neasily?\nWe observe that liquids have no fixed\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\nthe shape of the container in which they ar e\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\nare not rigid but can be called fluid.\nRefer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 wher e we\nsaw that solids and liquids can dif fuse into\nliquids. The gases fr om the atmosphere\ndiffuse and dissolve in water . These gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, ar e\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\nand plants.\nAll living cr eatur es need to br eathe for\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can br eathe\nunder water due to the pr esence of dissolved\noxygen  in water . Thus, we may conclude that\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\nliquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is\nReprint 2025-26\n", "MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 5higher  than that of solids.  This is due to the\nfact that in the liquid state, particles move\nfreely and have greater space between each\nother as compared to particles in the solid\nstate.\n1.3.3 THE GASEOUS  STATE\nHave you ever observed a balloon seller filling\na lar ge number of balloons fr om a single\ncylinder of gas? Enquire fr om him how many\nballoons is he able to fill fr om one cylinder .\nAsk him which gas does he have in the cylinder .\nActivity _____________ 1.11\n\u2022Take thr ee 100 mL syringes and close\ntheir nozzles by  rubber corks, as\nshown in Fig.1.4.\n\u2022Remove the pistons fr om all the\nsyringes.\n\u2022Leaving one syringe untouched, fill\nwater in the second and pieces of chalk\nin the thir d.\n\u2022Insert the pistons back into the\nsyringes. Y ou may apply some vaseline\non the pistons befor e inserting them\ninto the syringes for their smooth\nmovement.\n\u2022Now, try to compr ess the content by\npushing the piston in each syringe.We have observed that gases ar e highly\ncompr essible as compared to solids and\nliquids. The liquefied petr oleum gas (LPG)\ncylinder that we get in our home for cooking\nor the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\ncylinders is compr essed gas. Compr essed\nnatural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\nin vehicles. Due to its high compr essibility,\nlarge volumes of a gas can be compr essed\ninto a small cylinder and transported easily.\nWe  come to know of what is being cooked\nin the kitchen without even entering ther e,\nby the smell that r\neaches our nostrils. How\ndoes this smell reach us? The particles of the\naroma of food mix with the particles of air\nspread fr om the kitchen, r each us and even\nfarther away. The smell of hot cooked food\nreaches us in seconds; compare this with the\nrate of dif fusion of solids and liquids. Due to\nhigh speed of particles and lar ge space\nbetween   them, gases show the pr operty of\ndiffusing very fast into other gases.\nIn the gaseous state, the particles move\nabout randomly at high speed. Due to this\nrandom movement, the particles hit each\nother and also the walls of the container . The\npressur e exerted by the gas is because of this\nforce exerted by gas particles per unit ar ea\non the walls of the container .\nFig. 1.4\n\u2022What do you observe?

The\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\nmoving mor e freely. A stage is reached when\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\npressure is called its melting point.\nThe melting point of a solid is an indication\nof the strength of the force of attraction\nbetween its particles.\nThe melting point of ice is 273.15 K *. The\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion.\nWhen a solid melts, its temperature\nremains the same, so where does the heat\nenergy go?\nYou must have observed, during the\nexperiment of melting, that the temperatur e\nof the system does not change after the\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\nThis happens even though we continue to\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing thestate by overcoming the forces of attraction\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\ntemperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\nknown as the latent heat. The wor d latent\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat ener gy\nthat is r equir ed to change 1 kg of a solid into\nliquid at atmospheric pr essur e at its melting\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion.\nSo, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\nsame temperature.\nWhen we supply heat ener gy to water ,\nparticles start moving even faster .  At a certain\ntemperatur e, a point is r eached when the\nparticles have enough energy to break fr ee\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other . At\nthis temperatur e the liquid starts changing\ninto gas. The temperature at which a liquid\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pr essur e is\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\nphenomenon. Particles fr om the bulk of the\nliquid gain enough ener gy to change into the\nvapour state.\nFor water this temperature is 373 K\n(100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K).\nCan you define the latent heat of\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion.\nParticles in steam, that is, water vapour at\n373 K (1000 C) have mor e ener gy than water\nat the same temperatur e. This is because\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra ener gy\nin the for m of latent heat of vaporisation.\n*Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.So, we infer that the state of matter can\nbe changed into another state by changing\nthe temperature.\nWe have lear nt that substances ar ound\nus change state fr om solid to liquid and fr om\nliquid to gas on application of heat. But there\nReprint 2025-26\n", "SCIENCE 8enclosed in a cylinder? Will the particles come\ncloser?

The unit of pr essur e is Pascal (Pa):\n1 atmospher e = 1.01 \u00d7 105 Pa. The pr essur e of air in atmospher e is called atmospheric pr essur e. The\natmospheric pr essur e at sea level is 1 atmospher e, and is taken as the nor mal atmospheric pr essur e.\nFig. 1.7: Sublimation of camphorFig. 1.8: By applying pressure, particles of matter\ncan be brought close together\nApplying pressure and reducing\ntemperatur e can liquefy gases.\nHave you hear d of solid carbon dioxide\n(CO2)? It is stor ed  under high pr essur e. Solid\nCO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state\non decr ease of pr essur e to 1 atmospher e*\nwithout coming into liquid state. This is the\nreason that solid carbon dioxide is also known\nas dry ice.\nThus, we can say that pr essur e and\ntemperature deter mine the state of a\nsubstance, whether it will be solid, liquid\nor gas.\u2022Now, heat slowly and observe.\n\u2022What do you infer from the above\nactivity?\nA change of state directly from solid to gas\nwithout changing into liquid state is called\nsublimation and the direct change of gas to\nsolid without changing into liquid is called\ndeposition.\n1.4.2 EFFECT  OF CHANGE  \nOF PRESSURE\nWe have alr eady lear nt that the dif ference in\nvarious states of matter is due to the\ndifference in the distances between the\nconstituent particles.

W ater, when left uncovered, slowly\nchanges into vapour . Wet clothes dry up. What\nhappens to water in the above two examples?\nWe know that particles of matter are\nalways moving and are never at rest. At a given\ntemperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there\nare particles with different amounts of kinetic\nenergy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction\nof particles at the surface, having higher\nkinetic energy, is able to break away from the\nforces of attraction of other particles and gets\nconverted into vapour . This phenomenon of\nchange of  liquid into vapours at any\ntemperature below its boiling point is called\nevaporation.\n1.5.1 FACTORS  AFFECTING  EVAPORATION\nLet us understand this with an activity .\nActivity _____________ 1.14\n\u2022Take 5 mL of water in a test tube and\nkeep it near a window or under a fan.\n\u2022Take 5 mL of water in an open china\ndish and keep it near a window or\nunder a fan.\n\u2022Take 5 mL of water in an open china\ndish and keep it inside a cupboard or\non a shelf in your class.Q\nReprint 2025-26\n", "SCIENCE 10What\nyou have\nlearnt\n\u2022 Matter is made up of small particles.\n\u2022 The matter around us exists in three states\u2014solid, liquid\nand gas.\n\u2022 The forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in\nsolids, inter mediate in liquids and minimum in gases.\n\u2022 The spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic\nenergy of the particles ar e minimum in the case of solids,\nintermediate in liquids and maximum in gases.What happens when you pour some\nacetone (nail polish remover) on your palm?\nThe particles gain energy from your palm or\nsurroundings and evaporate causing the palm\nto feel cool.\nAfter a hot sunny day, people sprinkle\nwater on the r oof or open gr ound because\nthe lar\nge latent heat of vaporisation of water\nhelps to cool the hot sur face.\nCan you cite some mor e examples fr om\ndaily life wher e we can feel the ef fect of cooling\ndue to evaporation?\nWhy should we wear cotton clothes in\nsummer?\nDuring summer , we perspir e mor e\nbecause of the mechanism of our body which\nkeeps us cool.
